# SMART-PARKING-SYSTEMS
Create a smart parking systems 

In this project, I developed a Smart Parking System to monitor and manage parking space availability in real-time using IoT technology. The system detects whether a parking spot is occupied or free and communicates this information to users over the internet through a mobile app or web dashboard.

The hardware consisted of ultrasonic sensors or IR sensors placed at each parking spot to detect the presence of a vehicle. These sensors were connected to a microcontroller (such as ESP8266/ESP32) which collected the sensor data and uploaded it to a cloud platform using Wi-Fi. A cloud-based IoT service (like ThingSpeak, Blynk, or MQTT broker) displayed the parking status, enabling users to check available spaces remotely. Optionally, the system could also control barriers or gates automatically when a vehicle enters or exits.
